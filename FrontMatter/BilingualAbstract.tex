\noindent Asteroidal triple (AT for short) is a set of three vertices of a graph such that there is a path between any two of them avoiding the neighborhood of the third. Graphs that do not contain an asteroidal triple are called AT-free. The class of AT-free graphs is a type of graph for which many problems that are NP-complete in general graphs can be solved in polynomial time.

In this thesis, we have implemented three polynomial-time algorithms for AT-free graphs.

Specifically, the algorithm for computing the maximum independent set of Hajo Broersma, Ton Kloks, Dieter Kratsch, and Haiko MÃ¼ller\cite{at-free-independent-sets}. The algorithm for computing the Minimum Dominating Set of Dieter Kratsch\cite{at-free-independent-sets}. And the algorithm for the 3-Coloring problem of Juraj Stacho\cite{at-free-3-colouring}.
